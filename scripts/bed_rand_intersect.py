"""
From a set of regions and two sets of intervals inside those regions
compute (for each region separately) the overlap between the two sets
of intervals and the overlap in `nsamples` random coverings of the
regions with intervals having the same lengths. Prints the z-score relative
to the mean and sample stdev of the random coverings.

Currently intervals must be in bed 3+ format.

TODO: There are a few versions of this floating around, including a
      better/faster one using gap lists instead of bitsets. Need to track
      that down and merge as necessary.
